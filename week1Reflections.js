/*                   Week One Reflections Assignment

First, answer: how have you noticed your bootcamp knowledge grow 
or change during Programming Basics?

Answer 1: I would say that my knowledge is definitly improving from
the Algo app practice and code practice. I would say that having some mental
clicks while doing a few problems on a T-diagram really made some growth in
the way I can now solve a few algorithms.


Then, answer: how have you noticed your approach to learning change 
throughout Programming Basics?

Answer 2: My approach has changed as far as just trying to stay positive
and keep working on problems even if I dont exactly understand whats going on,
and sometimes I have a good breakthrough.



Finally, share: what do you consider your "Mistake of the Week," 
which was a valuable failure you learned from during Programming Basics?

Answer 3: I had many mistakes of the week, but I would say my biggest one
was under utilizing the T-Diagram in the start. I am still very green on
how to really use a T-Diagram. But if I would have figured out a bit sooner,
I definitly feel I could have a better understanding on how to break down code 
line by line. I ended up wasting about 8 hours the first week not really knowing
how to utilize a T-Diagram. I tried to use it on the computer and hand made them
on note pad, then in microsoft paint, then in google docs, and finally I just
went to paper after wasting so much valuable and crucial learning time. 
Also not really grasping the coding concepts and having to delete code I 
spent a few hours on building and over complicating code that should have been
built more simply. What I learned is to just try and simplify things and get
it to work to keep up in the classes. Also I will just keep pushing forward and
trying to learn as much as I can because I truly do enjoy solving problems
and having break throughs!
